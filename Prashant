This document outlines the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based query suggestion chatbot for WordPress sites. It leverages the Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy to improve the logical flow and relevance of responses. The system design includes data retrieval, embedding generation, RAG processing, and a chain of thought module. The document details the implementation process, testing and evaluation, and documentation. It also includes a clear evaluation benchmark for technical implementation, functionality and accuracy, and user experience, along with a deliverable review.
Implementation of the RAG-based Query Suggestion Chatbot with Chain of Thought for WordPress Sites: System Design :1)Data Retrieval: Utilize WordPress APIs to fetch real-time content updates. 2)Embedding Generator: Convert textual content into vector embeddings using models like Sentence-BERT. 3)Vector Database: Employ a system like Faiss to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently. 4)RAG Processor: Integrate RAG to generate responses based on retrieved information. 5)Chain of Thought Module: Develop this module to enhance the RAG outputs with logical progression and context continuity. 6)User Interface: Design an interactive chat interface that can dynamically display the chatbot's thought process.

Implementation of WordPress Data Retrieval and Embedding Generation
import wordpress
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize WordPress API client
wp_client = wordpress.WordPressClient('https://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2')

# Define a function to fetch new and updated content
def fetch_content():
    posts = wp_client.get_posts()
    for post in posts:
        text = post.content.rendered
        embeddings = generate_embeddings(text)
        update_vector_database(post.id, embeddings)

# Define a function to generate embeddings
def generate_embeddings(text):
    model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-bert-base-nli-mean-tokens')
    embeddings = model.encode(text)
    return embeddings

# Define a function to update the vector database
def update_vector_database(post_id, embeddings):
    # Implement Faiss vector database update logic here
    pass
